We need packages on the NPM registry that will be used in multiple projects. The advantage to this is versioning, and the ability to easily install the packages on new projects we will be working on. These packages will be simple functions that aren't propritary to ATS whatsoever.

In order to accomplish this, we'll need to create two ATS organization accounts. One on github.com, and one on npmjs.com. Github lets you create an organization account for free, where npmjs charges $7/user/month.
